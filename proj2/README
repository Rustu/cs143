Description of my methodology can be found in my html write-up.
The best performance I was able to achieve was 81% matching, as you will see in my code.
I have not tried it on other images, and have implemented no extra credit.
Also, please forgive my late handin. I messaged the TA staff regarding a keyboard issue I had. I was able to fix it, but it set me back a good amount of time.
Thanks,
